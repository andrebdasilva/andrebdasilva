**I'm a front-end developer, I'm looking to professionalize myself in the area of web development, creating desktop and mobile applications.  <br><br>In my free time I like to watch movies, series, play the keyboard and produce music.  <br><br>I've always found it very easy to learn software and hardware, I like to know how things work, identify and solve problems, study in depth and discover alternatives, and apply what I learned.  <br><br>I have worked in other professional areas of creation, arts, music, sound design, sound engineer, mix and master, and in the formal sectors of production, logistics and retail.**
